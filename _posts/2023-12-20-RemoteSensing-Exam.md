# While challenging, what are definitions of the main ideas
o On the theoretical side we have concepts such as immersion (technical reading), 
presence, interaction, agency, paradigm shift
o On the practical side, we have technology that is characterized by the realityvirtuality continuum.
o What is a digital twin?


• What is the difference between the original reality-virtuality continuum by Milgrim and 
Kishino and the revised proposal by Flavian et al. 2019
• What is the difference between internal and external devices according to Flavian et al. 
2019
• What is the EPI cube (explain its axes) and how can it be used to categorize 
technologies
• What is design thinking?
• What are the five stages of design thinking according to the Stanford d.school of design?
• What happens in each of the five stages?
• What, in particular, is ideation and what are we using it for?
• Gamestorming offers many valuable methods for developing immersive designs. Can 
you explain the 3-12-3 methods, what affinity mapping is and how you could use role 
play in the design process?
• Evaluation is a central aspect of every design. What do we mean by the scientific 
method?
• What are Peirce's methods of “fixing beliefs”?
• What are examples of methods of how we can systematically evaluate immersive 
experiences?
• What are physiological signals?
• What is the system usability scale?
• How do we measure presence?
• What are data types typically used in ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity?
• What are the names of different ArcGIS data layers available in ArcGIS Maps SDK for 
Unity? How do they look like in the Unity scene?
• Understand the meaning of isovist in architectural design.
• Understand the meaning of LiDAR point clouds.
• What does the term “sense of place” mean? How does XR contribute to place-based 
education?• What does the theory of embodied cognition propose?
• Spatial presence is the sense of physically being in an XR environment. What are the
different stages of the two-level model as proposed by Wirth et al. (2007)? How can they 
be used to explain the formation of spatial presence? 
• Cognitive load theory proposes three types of load: intrinsic, germane, and extraneous. 
Why is it important to consider cognitive load in the design and development of XR 
applications?
• What is MARIN?
• Why are they interested in immersive technologies?
• What is the Seven Ocean Simulator Center?
• What is TNO?
• What is TNO's vision for immersive technologies?
• What are TNO's ethical considerations regarding immersive technologies?
• What is TNO's vision for the future of human connection?
• Consider the differences between bottom-up and top-down modelling (Is it also possible 
to visualise this process using a diagram?)
• We covered several basic texturing layers, it’s good to understand the difference(s) 
between them.
• What is key for 3D animation and how do we set up a character for animating?
• Understand horizontal and vertical movement in Unity
• How should we consider the structure of a virtual 3D environment?
• Remember the primitive object types that can be created directly within Unity
• Understand the difference between Edit Mode and Play Mode inside the Unity editor.
• Understand the difference between Start() and Update() functions in a C# script. 
• Understand why use prefabs in Unity.
• Know how to toggle the visibility of a GameObject from the script in Unity
• Know how to apply force to an object in Unity
• Photogrammetry
o Basics of camera setting
o Basics of software used for photogrammetry
• What is a digital twin, what can you do with it
• How are digital twins connected to XR
