## Software & Data
##### Software Engineer
Andrioid client> PHP web seivices> MySQL database
##### Data Scientist
extraction tool 
machine learning 
recommendation tool
##### Software Development
Waterfall Model
## inside DBMS
#### Management of Information
#### Accurate
strict data types enfored(int string, varchar)
Lebgth of data types
#### Consistent
interoperable or flow sync between sysyems or depts
#### Security
privacy policy
accidental record loss
## Better data= better decisions
## Requirement Elicitation
observations
brainstorming storytelling
interviews: unstrutured, open-end questions
prototyping

backwards compatibility
## Standardised data
refine, combine and re-use data
generate dictionary to describe the data-meta data
## Entities
### View
virtual tables
combine tables using join or just a subset of one table
hide large complicated queries>> performance
once created, can be used and accessed as any table in the DB>> security
## SQL Attack
#### How to stop SQL injection
Sanitization: removing illegal characters form user inputs
SQL Injection is an attack type that exploits bad SQL statements
## DATA Audit(审计)
User Access and Authentication
Data Unauthorised users, restricted data
### How to audit?
Identifying and tracking details such as the 
user, time, data, and change activities can 
help companies comply with many data 
compliance rules, and this auditing function 
will take on added importance with the new 
GDPR compliance requirements
