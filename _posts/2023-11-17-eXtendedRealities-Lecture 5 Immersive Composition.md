# Recap
Animation considerations
Inverse-Kinetics
#### Why optimise 3D models for game engine use?
Higher polygon counts in the scene can decrease the frame rate

BIM Building information model(very details)
#### Reducing polygons for models
texture
polygons
less important models and have it lower polygons
#### N-Gons
a polygon with more than four vertices and edges
# Principles of Virtual Composition
## Virtual Environment
a form of software
goal-directed play> more players, rules, organised,outcome
## Levels Creation
scenarios within a simulation
Gaming Environment 
Gaming Events: trigger
Framing of Virtual Camera>> FPS
Game Objectives
## Gameplay within the space
what gameplay occurs in the space
## Architectural Spatial Arrangements
size and shape
arrange the objects>> open /closed , challenges of indoor vs outdoor
#### Furnished and unfurnished spaces
## Visual Communication in Design
include noticing visual elements
landmarks > visual cues
## Social Interactions
consider when designing the level
location within the defined space
Player can interact with each other through speech
## Boundaries
will occur naturally
## Workflow for Asset or Environment Planning
11 step preproduction blueprint
### Environment Story
the environment to help tell the story of the game
### Focal Points
# Part 3 Game World
culture> moral values
### How Game Worlds Entertain
### Dimensions of a Game World
spatial dimension
2D game world
3D game world
### Scale
# Part 4 Engaging Environments and Emotioneering
## Affecting Interest
Inherent interest
Poetry of Presentation
Psychological Proximity

## The Hero's Journey be Joseph Campbell
